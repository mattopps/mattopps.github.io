Q: What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

A: I think I mostly have a decent handle on padding, less so on borders and even less so on margins. I get the concepts but not the use. The one thing I'm unclear about with padding is if there is a way to center the text/content of an element in the center of the padding without having to adjust the top and bottom padding. vertical align will center the content/text but only on the horizontal axis, not in the true center of the box, in other words, it gets moved to the top-middle of the box.

The border is the demarcation of the padding and the visible separation of the content from other elements on the page. the margin determines the spacing between the element and other elements.

Q: What did you learn about CSS positioning?

A: It is tough. need a lot more practice.

Q: What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

A: The header welcome banner and the banner for the quote on the bottom were the easiest. Everything else was incredibly difficult. I experimented with every type of display and position possible. And I couldn't sense any rhyme or reason to when things moved to where they moved to and when they would look as I intended them to.This was especially the case for the sidebars and the links I had on the left and right sides of the page.

Q: What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

A: I learned that I still have a lot to learn. I learned that it is easier and more consistent for top/bottom/left/right placement to use % or vh/wh over pixels to place things on a page. I learned that some elements take precedence and override the css of others, ids being the highest level of css(inline styling in the html would override ids in css, but... that's not in css)
