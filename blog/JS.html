      <p> Hello Again Blog!</p>
       <p>I really like me some Ruby. Relative to all other computer languages I know at this point I can safely say that I think Ruby is the best. For now. Maybe.</p>
       <p>I just feel like switching from Ruby to JS is like switching to car without AC, a radio, GPS, or basically anything that would help you do what you need to do in the car other than literally making the wheels go or stop or turn. There is so much functionality that I assume is basic and obvious for all computer languages because Ruby had it. I mean JS can't reverse a string. It can't randomize the items in an array, nor flatten nested arrays (all particularly vexing problems when I was trying to make my JS version of that most elementary card game: War). Because in JS an array is really basically an object that happens to be in order. </p>
       <p>Having said all that, some things in JS are more user friendly. specifically I can think only of for loops right now. But that is a big one. Iteration in Ruby comes in many varieties. I got into the habit early on of using while loops with incremented variables to keep track of the conditionals. JS for loops put all that into one neat little line that lets you increment however you want as the third argument passed into the for loop. A Ruby while loop can be very similar, but not as obvious to read because often the incrementing variable and the degree of incrementation are separated by a code block or two.</p>
       <p>Other than that there are just a lot of little things that are different. Back to the car analogy. It's is a bit like things are just in weird places. JS makes you write var before every variable. It's like having to yell "Turning" before every turn you make. Sure that's kind of what the blinkers are for. (But if so the JS equivalent would have me yell twice. 1 - I'm hitting the blinker. 2 - I'm Turning. Oh, And I wouldn't be able to reverse. I would have to take apart the car piece by piece, move everything around. then build a new car that points in the opposite direction and then go.) </p>
