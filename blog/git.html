      Hello Blog!
    </p>
        Today I learned a bit more about version control software, which is a way to ensure that neither time nor effort are wasted when working on any project. It works well enough for a solo user but becomes proportionately more important with an increasing number of collaborators and/or on increasingly more complicated projects. Every user can create a separate version of the main project to work on privately and save his or her work after every single change. The system then allows any of those copies to be accessed at a later point should it prove necessary to start over because something got messed up after that point. If used properly it prevents anybody from having to redo their work or from interfering with somebody else's work on the same team

        I had some serious unlearning to do on github today. The only other times I used git for a week I pushed the commits from the master. It was just add,commit,push,pull. bing bang boom, 4th b word. I learned a whole new method today and I definitely still do not 100% have it. Updates to follow.

        I like the idea of git. It allows you to share your code amazingly easily with whomever you want. I guess if you were just working by yourself and wanted input or advice you would have to email your files to people. If you knew you were only ever sharing it with one person there might be a negligible difference. but anything more complex than that and a direct communication system would be time consuming. In the case of multiple people working together on something, I can't even imagine how they would do their work without github. Github allows any number of people to simultaneously edit the same file without interfering with anybody else's work. It almost seems to good to be true. And every saved stage of change can still be accessed later. It is a pretty amazing thing.
