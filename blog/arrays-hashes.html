      Hello Again Blog!
    </p>
       <p>Today we will discuss a little about the basic ways to store data. The two most popular and useful ways to store data are in containers called arrays and hashes. They are similar but have a few very noteworthy differences in both performance and syntax/appearance.</p>

       <p>If you are just trying to make a simple list, ex. for groceries, for favorite days of the year, or for things to remember to put someplace, arrays are very useful.</p>

       <p>Hashes are great for storing things that have to be specifically stored in a certain way. So if you just wanted to write a list of days to mark off on the calendar as bank holidays, but it didn't matter what the names of the holidays were, you could make an array with the dates.</p>
       <p>Creating an array is pretty straigtforward. Brackets [] are the containers for an array. Give it a name, like $list, set it equal to some brackets, like so - <code>$list = []</code>. In between the brackets write whatever you want to be in the list and separate each item by a comma. Like this - <code>$ list = [item_1, item_2, item_3]
       </code><code>$holidays = ["New Year's", "President's Day", "Independence Day", Thanksgiving"]</code></p>

       <p>If you wanted to remember what about some day was particularly special and worthwhile remembering, for example, the birthdays of all of your family and firends, then a hash is the way to go. Each person's name in the Hash can be linked to a specific day for that person's birthday.</p>
      
      <p>The syntax for creating a hash is very similar to an array but with {} instead of[]. so we could write $Birthdays = {}. Filling up the hash is significantly different than an array though, each person has to be linked specifically to one day, and only one day. There can't be more than one day per person. Though certainly multiple people could be born on the same day. As indeed I was. I am not a twin, but my brother and sister are. So if I made a Birthday hash for my family three people would have the same birthday. each pair of names and birthdays are called a key value pair. the names are the keys, the unique identifiers that link to a certain value, in this case the birthday. there are many ways to do this. Today we will just use simple strings. 
      $Birthdays = {"John" => "2/29/1982",
                    "Jacob" => "1/23/1945",
                    "Jinnie" => "5/5/1999",
                    "Heidi" =>  "6/7/1989"
                    }</p>
