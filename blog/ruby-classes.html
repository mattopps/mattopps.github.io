      <p> Hello Again Blog!</p>
       <p></p>
    
      <p> Here are three examples of possible code to mirror how an iphone could be delineated as a real world object.</p>
        
        <section><div id = "column1"> 
          <code>
            class Phone<br>
  
        		  def initialize(name)<br>
      				  @name = name <br>
      			  end<br>
      		  end<br>

      		  Class Cellphone < Phone<br>
      		  end<br>

      		  Class Smartphone < Cellphone<br>
      		  end<br>

      		  Class Iphone < Smartphone<br>
      		  end<br>

            my_iphone = Iphone.new</code></div>
        
        <div id = "column2">
          <code>
            class Phone<br>
  
              def initialize(name)<br>
                @name = name <br>
              end<br>
            end<br>

            Class Cellphone < Phone<br>
            end<br>

            Class Smartphone < Cellphone<br>
            end<br>

            my_iphone = Smarthpone.new</code></div>
        
        <div id = "column3">
          <code>
           class Phone<br>
  
              def initialize(name)<br>
                @name = name <br>
              end<br>
            end<br>

            Class Cellphone < Phone<br>
            end<br>


            my_iphone = Cellphone.new</code></div></section>

  <section id = "content">
    <p>In the first example in the column on the left the iphone is unique among smartphones. It exists as a separate class, a separate type of thing, than all other non iphone smartphones. The arrow pointing from the higher class to the lower class indicates that the class on the left of the arrow has all the stuff and can do all the stuff of the class on the right (because it is one of them) but the stuff the the class on the left can do is different. So a cellphone can make and receive calls just like a phone. But only cellphones can do so outside of your house or office or any specific location. </p> 

    <p>The second column in the middle shows how it would look if we thought of an iphone as a type of smartphone much like the many other advanced smartphones that exist. This example shows how it might look if we decided that for all intents and purposes an iphone is not so different from a Galaxy or Nexus or Blackberry. If this were the case, an iphone would not be it's own class but an example, that is an instance, of the class of smartphones.</p>

    <p> In the third column to the right we display how it would look if we defined an iphone as just a type of cellphone, and we didn't even distinguish smart phone as being so different that they needed to be in their own category. 5 years ago this would probably have been less likely to be a real possibility, but the percentage of cell phones in use that don't offer web browsing, app usage, and advanced functionality closer to a mini computer than a traditional phone is very small. </p>

    <p>Then again there are several types of iphones. The following models are still sold 4s, 5s, 5c, 6, 6+, 6s, 6s+. Each are distinct. There are some features that are on all of them. Siri is a great example. Some basic apple apps like messages, phone, reminders, calendar, and mail are common to all iphones. Apple pay, wallet, touch, and 3d touch are all unique to some models. So would it make sense to represent each of these phones as it's own class? Should we add a fourth column above that has different classes for every new iphone release? and then every individual phone would be a new instance of that iphone. EX if you and your partner and family each had an iphone 6, each of you could identify your own iphone by creating a new instance of the iphone 6 class by writing <code>my_iphone = iphone6.new</code>. and your brother could write <code>brophone = iphone6.new</code>. And if somebody else had an iphone6s+ they might have to create the representation of their phone by writing <code>other_phone = Iphone6splus.new</code>(the '+' symbol would create an error in this context.)</p></section></main>
