    <h1>Getting to Know This Guy</h1>
    <p>Hello all. A little about me. I am usually up working late.</p>
    
    <p>I enjoy a diverse range of media styles and genres. Some of my favorite movies are V for Vendetta, Ocean's 11, and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Catch-22 may be the greatest book in the history of books.</p>
    
    <p>I am from the northeast and I want to not end in the northeast. Cold is not as good as Warm</p>

    <p>I like to walk, jog, bike, yogacize, sometimes golf. Sometimes do the NYT crossword but lately I have been finding it gimmicky. </p>

    <p>Just about everything about me is quirky. Some by choice some by destiny. I share a birthday with two other siblings. two of them are twins. I am not. It usually falls during this here holiday season</p></div></main>
